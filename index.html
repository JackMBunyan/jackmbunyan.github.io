        <b>Hi! I'm Jack</b>, a third-year student at the University of Bristol
        where I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science. My interests are
        in backend development, financial mathematics and data science
        solutions, although I also have some experience as a full-stack
        developer. More recently, I have been interested in agent-based models
        to solve problems or to study their behaviour in relation to real world
        scenarios. Please use the above navigation bar to check out some of my
        projects or read my CV.<br /><br />I am currently an active member of
        the
        <a class="link" href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/" target="_blank"
          >Bristol Computer Science Society's</a
        >
        committee as the Sports and Socials Officer. My role involves organising
        and running social and academic events for all students with an interest
        in Computer Science; planning and executing bar socials, quiz events and
        networking opportunities.
