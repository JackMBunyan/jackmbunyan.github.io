        <b>Hi! I'm Jack</b>, a third-year student at the University of Bristol
        where I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science. My interests are
        in backend development and data science solutions, although I also have
        some experience as a full-stack developer. My other passions include
        coding events such as game jams and capture the flag challenges.
        <br /><br />I am currently an active member of the
        <a class="link" href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/" target="_blank"
          >Bristol Computer Science Society's</a
        >
        committee as the Sports and Socials Officer. My role involves organising
        and running social and academic events for all students with an interest
        in Computer Science; in particular, I have hosted multiple quiz nights
        and planned pub crawls.
