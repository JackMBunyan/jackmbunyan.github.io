        <b>An improvement on the current iterated learning model:</b> ILMs are
        used to reflect the concept of language evolution within a population of
        teacher and learner agents. I have been employing neural networks and
        genetic algorithmic concepts to implement such models, while
        endeavoruing to decrease the computational complexity required to run
        these simulations. The aim is to present a new model for which to
        simulate language evolution that does not require an obversion process.

        completed to prevent world domination. My role was to devlop four small

        team and I mainly facilitated backend development, working with gradle
        build scripts and Spring Boot itself.

        developed a Halloween themed endless runner shooter game. Written in lua
        as part of the PICO-8 fantasy console. The time pressure nature of the
        event allowed me to practice working to a tight deadline and gave me an
        insight into the need to prioritise features for a timed release. The
        PICO-8 environment is intentionally limited to replicate an old games
        console with tight limitations like a fixed 32k data capacity, so
        working on it was an exciting challenge. View the project on

        <b>First-year coursework to implement game logic:</b> Scotland Yard is a
        turn-based strategy board game where a team of detectives search to
        capture a fugitive, Mr. X, in a set number of moves. Our unit director
        gave us a skeleton codebase with the graphical design in place and it
        was our job to implement the game logic and rules. An open end extension
        to the project involved implementing an AI to contol Mr.X to escape the
        detectives. I implemented a Breadth-First Search with postion analysis
        to decide on the best moves for Mr. X at each turn. The project was
        written in Java exclusively.
