        Led a team of fellow students that developed a video link between two
        interactive sculptures based on Aardman's famous character, Gromit.
        Implemented using a Java Spring Boot backend with a REACT app frontend.
        Part of a second year unit called Software Project Engineering, where I
        utilised good industry team practices: using Kanban board, Git Actions
        and an AGILE development mentality. The workload was split amongst the
        team and I mainly facilitated backend development, working with gradle
        build scripts and Spring Boot itself.

      <p class="proj_desc">
        <b>Bristol Computer Science Society's annual game jam event:</b> Took
        part in a 24hr game jam event hosted by the Bristol CSS where I
        developed a Halloween themed endless runner shooter game. Written in lua
        as part of the PICO-8 fantasy console. The time pressure nature of the
        event allowed me to practice working to a tight deadline and gave me an
        insight into the need to prioritise features for a timed release. The
        PICO-8 environment is intentionally limited to replicate an old games
        console with tight limitations like a fixed 32k data capacity, so
        working on it was an exciting challenge. View the project on

      <p class="proj_desc">
        <b>First-year coursework to implement game logic:</b> Scotland Yard is a
        turn-based strategy board game where a team of detectives search to
        capture a fugitive, Mr. X, in a set number of moves. Our unit director
        gave us a skeleton codebase with the graphical design in place and it
        was our job to implement the game logic and rules. An open end extension
        to the project involved implementing an AI to contol Mr.X to escape the
        detectives. I implemented a Breadth-First Search with postion analysis
        to decide on the best moves for Mr. X at each turn. The project was
        written in Java exclusively.

      <p class="proj_desc">
        <b>A bi-directional Dijkstra's Algorithm:</b> For my A-Level project, I
        developed a rotuing software for my school's buildings with the
        intention being to help new students or staff navigate their way around.
        Development was solely in Python, utilising both imperative and
        object-orientated programming paradigms for my solution. The backend
        graph traversal algorithm was accessed via a Graphical User Interface
        using Python's guizero library. I received an A* for the end product in
        my assessment. View the project on

        <b>One week of work shadowing:</b> At the end of Year 12 I completed one
        week of work experience with DTSquared, a London-based data management
        company. During my time there I tested out a new product for them,
        Snowflake, a data warehousing tool. However, I also shadowed the team on
        their day to day work and learnt the principles of data governance and
        understanding real-world clients.
