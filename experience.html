      <h3>NXTGen Consultant</h3>
      <p class="proj_desc">
        After finishing my studies at the University of Bristol, I have enrolled
        in the NXTGen graduate scheme with the ProjectiveGroup. I will be
        training as, and then acting as, a data consultant within their team for
        the foreseeable future. I am excited to see what challenges I will be
        facing and the work I will be doing. Ultimately, I am looking forward to
        starting my career on a high note.

      <h3>Lead Teaching Assistant<br />(IBM Cloud Specialist)</h3>
      <p class="proj_desc">
        During my third year, I worked for the University of Bristol as one of
        their teaching assistants on the second year unit Software Engineering
        Project. As well as mentoring a group, I was responsible for advising
        the students in using IBM's cloud infrastructure - which they kindly
        provided for the students to use in this unit for their assigned
        projects. In particular, I was guiding the students on the Kubernetes
        and Code Engine servives and acting as an administrator for the group
        resources. The work involved a high level of independance and time
        management from myself, as I was doing it alongside my own studies.

      <h3>Maths Support Teacher</h3>
      <p class="proj_desc">
        For a few months during my first year of university, when I was forced
        to study from home due to the restrictions in place, my old school
        reached out to A-Level maths graduates: asking if we'd be willing to
        support some students struggling with GCSE maths. I accepted and became
        a part-time teacher at the school. I was given a couple of small classes
        of students to teach a variety of maths to. For the few months that I
        was there, I was proud to see my groups' abilities increase and their
        ability to answer questions improve.
